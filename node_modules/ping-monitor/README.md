# Website uptime Event Emitter

Ping-monitor (Node-Monitor) is a tool for monitoring your website's uptime. If the website is up or down an event is emitted. This module is extracted from [Node Ping](https://github.com/qawemlilo/node-ping), an uptime app I wrote recently.

# Installation
```
npm install ping-monitor
```


# How to use
```
var Monitor = require('ping-monitor');

var myWebsite = new Monitor(options);

myWebsite.on(event, callback(response) {
    // Do something with the response 
});
```


## Options

- `website` (* required) - The url of the website to be monitored.
- `interval` (defaults to 15) - time interval(in minutes) for checking website availability.



## Emitted Events

- `up` - All is good website is up.
- `down` - Not good, website is down.
- `error` - Bad, http request module cannot load website.
- `stop` - Fired when the monitor has stopped.



## response object

- `object.website` - website being monitored.
- `object.time` - time in milliseconds.
- `object.responseCode` - http response code.
- `object.responseMessage` -  http response code message.



## Example
```
var Monitor = require('ping-monitor');


var myWebsite = new Monitor({
    website: 'http://www.ragingflame.co.za',
    interval: 10
});


myWebsite.on('error', function (msg) {
    console.log(msg);
});


myWebsite.on('up', function (res) {
    console.log('Yay!! ' + res.website + ' is up.');
});


myWebsite.on('down', function (res) {
    console.log('Oh Snap!! ' + res.website + ' is down! ' + res.statusMessage);
});


// this event is required to be handled in all Node-Monitor instances
myWebsite.on('error', function (res) {
    console.log('Oh Snap!! An unexpected error occured trying to load ' + res.website + '!');
    myWebsite.stop();
});


myWebsite.on('stop', function (website) {
    console.log(website + ' monitor has stopped.');
});
```


## Testing
